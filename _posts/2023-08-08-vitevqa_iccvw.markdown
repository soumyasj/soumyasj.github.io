This paper explores the NewsVideoQA and M4-ViteVQA datasets for video question answering based on textual content, analyzing their formulation and the required visual and multi-frame comprehension. We also examine BERT-QA's performance and the challenges of domain adaptation between the datasets, highlighting out-of-domain training benefits.
