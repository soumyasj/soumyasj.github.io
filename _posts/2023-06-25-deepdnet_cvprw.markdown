We propose a novel VideoQA task that requires reading and understanding the text in the video. We focus on news videos and require QA systems to comprehend and answer questions about the topics presented by combining visual and textual cues in the video. We introduce the “NewsVideoQA” dataset that comprises more than 8,600 QA pairs on 3,000+ news videos obtained from diverse news channels from around the world.
