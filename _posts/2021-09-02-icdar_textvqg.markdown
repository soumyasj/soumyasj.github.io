We present a novel problem of text-based visual question generation or TextVQG in short. Given the recent growing interest of the document image analysis community in combining text understanding with conversational artificial intelligence, e.g., text-based visual question answering, TextVQG becomes an important task. TextVQG aims to generate a natural language question for a given input image and an automatically extracted text also known as OCR token from it such that the OCR token is an answer to the generated question.
