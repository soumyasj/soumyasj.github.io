I am an M.S. student in [Computer Science at Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/). My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

Previously I worked as a Research Assistant with [Dr. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/) at the Vision, Language, and Learning Group ([VL2G](https://vl2g.github.io/)), [Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/). At VL2G, I worked on external knowledge-aware image retrieval and [visual relationship co-localization](https://vl2g.github.io/projects/vrc/).

Before that, I worked in Health Service Team at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangalore (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) for 2 years. There, I worked on health and fitness tracking services (pedometer, sleep monitor, heart-rate monitor) of wearable devices and BLE/NFC communication between smartwatch and fitness machines ([CES2020 News](https://www.technogym.com/int/newsroom/samsung-watch-ces-compatible/)). I also worked on developing an [on-device pose-estimation system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8856547) for [Samsung Health Workout Programs](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/samsung-health/#programs) which uses Optical Flow, Dynamic Time Warping and CNN to detect deviations from the ideal exercise pose and suggest corrections.

I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) in 2017.
