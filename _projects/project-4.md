In this project, we built a compiler from scratch using lex and yacc (for lexical and semantic analysis) in Python to generate x86 assembly language from NIM program. The compiler supported basic data types (INT, BOOL, CHAR, STRING), Arrays, Arithmetic and Logical Operators, if-else conditions, while loop, functions(including recursive) and type checking.
