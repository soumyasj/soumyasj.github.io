I am a Master's by Researcg student at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad, India. I work under the guidance of Prof. C V Jawahar. My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Multimodal Learning and Natural Language Processing. This field of study excites me and pushes me to work much harder everyday.

Previously I have worked Prof. Shankar Gangisetty on text-based multimodal learning. I have also worked as a Research Assistant with Prof. B A Patil at Think & Ink Education and Research Foundation, on magnitude spectrum and descriptive statistics on color models for soil classification.

I was a part of mentors at Winter Workshop and an active member at Computer Vision and Graphics Lab, KLE Technological University, Hubballi, India.

I completed my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from KLE Technological University in 2021.

More about me!
I make friends very easily. I love sketching, it takes me to a transe-phase. Animals have my heart and I look forward to groom them throughout my life. I occasionally sing (I have learnt Hidustani Music for over 10 years) and yeah, I can cook some great dishes. Walking, badminton, running, home workout sessions help me balance the amount of food I consume on daily basis. To know more you know where to ping me!
